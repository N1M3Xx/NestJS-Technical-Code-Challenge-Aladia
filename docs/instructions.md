NestJS Technical Code Challenge

🎯 Objective

    Build a NestJS monorepo backend using the apps/ structure. You must create two apps:
    apps/gateway: exposes a public HTTP REST API.
    apps/authentication: a microservice responsible for user management.


The two apps must communicate internally via TCP using NestJS Microservices and a NetworkingService.

The challenge is intended to evaluate your ability to:

    Organize a monorepo.
    Structure feature code into modules using MVC patterns (Controller, Service, Repository).
    Use DTOs, RTOs, request/response patterns.
    Integrate microservices using internal message passing (via TCP).
    Apply NestJS ecosystem patterns such as validation, Swagger, caching, and Dockerization.


✅ Requirements

🏗️ Project Architecture

Use a modular NestJS Monorepo.

Structure the project to match:

    apps/
    gateway/
    authentication/
    common/
    core/
    config/


Do NOT use Clean or Hexagonal Architecture. Stick to Controller → Service → Repository.

Implement all HTTP logic in apps/gateway.

Implement all business logic and persistence in apps/authentication.


📦 Feature: User Management (Example Use Case)

Implement the following endpoints in the Gateway:

    POST /auth/register → Register a new user
    GET /auth/users → Get all users
    In Authentication service, handle the logic and persistence for:
    Registering a user.
    Listing all users.
    Use TCP messaging to forward requests from gateway to microservice.


✅ Mandatory Features

    Validation: Use class-validator and DTOs for request validation.
    Database: Use MongoDB (Mongoose) or another database of your choice.
    Microservices.


Use @nestjs/microservices to connect gateway with authentication.

🧩 Suggested Bonus Features (Optional)

    JWT-based login flow.
    Centralized logging module.
    Test coverage (unit/e2e).
    Health checks or readiness probes.
    Rate limiting or throttling.


📹 Video Walkthrough (Required)

    Record a 5–15 minute Loom/Vidyard (or similar) walkthrough:
    Brief introduction (name, background).
    Explain your file structure and architectural decisions.
    Walk through core code: controllers, services, DTOs, networking.
    Demonstrate the API using Apidog/Postman.
    Show Docker setup if applicable.


📬 What to Submit

    ✅ GitHub repository link (public).
    ✅ Video walkthrough link.
    (Optional) Postman/Apidog collection.
    (Optional) README or extra documentation.
